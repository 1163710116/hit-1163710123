# hit-1163710123
A1 (5%, individual): set up GitHub repository (text file containing github.com/<username>/hit-<student ID>), due Jul 3

Set up a public GitHub repository and put source code into it (reuse code from a previous project or "Hello World" program). In addition to code, the repository needs to contain: A README.md file, a CONTRIBUTING.md file, a LICENSE.md file, and a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. Feel free to reuse content from other GitHub repositories you find online for the .md files (but not for the source code)!
